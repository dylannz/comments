# AJAX comment system

Features:

* AJAX comment submission
* Threaded replies
* Gravatar 
* Link to specific comments with #comment_X
* Basic clientside and serverside input validation

## Configuration
Copy config.default.php to config.php and make any necessary changes to fit your setup.

## Framework
This project does not use an existing PHP framework. I wrote it myself to show knowledge of code rather than knowledge of a particular framework.

## Database
A MySQL database server is required. The SQL for the database is included in comments.sql.
